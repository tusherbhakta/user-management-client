# User Management Client

This is a simple **React.js** application that serves as the client-side interface for the **User Management Server**. The project demonstrates how to connect a client-side application to a RESTful API, handle user input, and manage state using React.

## Features
- **User List Display**: Fetch and display a list of users from the server.
- **Add User Form**: A form to add new users to the server via a POST request.
- **State Management**: Manage application state using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Automatically update the user list when a new user is added.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:
1. To understand how to consume APIs in a React application.
2. Learn how to use `fetch` for HTTP requests.
3. Explore basic state and form handling in React.
4. Practice integration of a client-side application with a backend server.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the UI.

## Prerequisites
- Make sure the **User Management Server** is running locally at `http://localhost:5000`.
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher) for running the React development environment.

## How to Run the Project Locally
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-client.git
   cd user-management-client
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application**:
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Test the Features**:
   - **View Users**: Open the application and view the list of users retrieved from the server.
   - **Add a User**: Use the form to add a new user and observe the updated list.

## Application Flow
1. **Fetch Users**:
   - The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch the list of users from the `/users` endpoint of the server when the application loads.
2. **Add a User**:
   - A form collects user details (name and email).
   - The `handleAddUsers` function sends the data to the server's `/users` endpoint via a POST request.
   - The new user is dynamically added to the list upon successful response from the server.

## API Endpoints Consumed
The following API endpoints from the **User Management Server** are consumed:
1. **GET `/users`**:
   - Fetches the list of users.
2. **POST `/users`**:
   - Adds a new user to the server.

## Future Enhancements
- Add form validation to prevent invalid data submission.
- Implement error handling for failed API requests.
- Style the application using frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.
- Use a state management library like Redux for better scalability.
- Add search and filter functionality for the user list.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a foundational learning experience for building React-based client applications and integrating them with a backend API. It's a great starting point for more advanced client-server projects.
